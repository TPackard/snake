Notes
=====

Things to look at:
  * SIGWINCH, signal sent on window size change.

Things to fix:
  * Show score
  * Spawn snake in random position/shape/direction
  * Figure out why it sometimes prints unkown characters
  * Detect terminal dimensions, spawn food all over
  * Game over screen/better resetting
  * Try to clean up arena drawing code
  * Catch errors to function calls (getch, etc.)
  * Smoother animation with fractional block characters
